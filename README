========================
klomp - CLI music player
========================

klomp is a set of perl scripts that manage mplayer in an mpd-like fashion.
The goal is to have a pure command line music player with powerful searching,
and to work on portable linux devices {e.g.: maemo/meego/mer}.

Core requirements are GNU/Linux, mplayer, and perl.
{plus optional requirements for reading tags from different filetypes}
Works nicely on the N900.


**** Features ****
-Stateless: if you delete the db, it can be 100% automatically rebuilt
  never modifies song files: very nice, robust tagging utilities already exist
-Modular: well-defined, non-interactive cli
-Quasi-portable: most features depend only on gnu/linux
  very few dependencies {apart from tagging when db building}
  all perl/python scripts, not compiled
-Powerful query language {really powerful, but not well-documented}
-Flacmirror:
  lossless audio on your computer, tiny oggs on your phone, transparently
-optional curses interface that invokes the same modular commands
-resume playback from the position you quit in the current song
-moderate resource consumption {runs smoothly on N900 - 256MB ram, 600mhz cpu}
-separation of db-building and playback/playlists;
  you can build the db on one computer,
  copy it elsewere, and search/play it without installing the tagging deps


**** Limitations ****
klomp-db tags only: mp3, flac, ogg, m4a, wma, wav
everything else can do anything mplayer can


**** Files ****
COPYING - GPLv3
README - ?????? wtf is this thing?
flacmirror - rsync style ogg->flac conversion util {parallel dir structure}
klomp - interactive python curses ui; query db, view/edit playlist
klomp-call-handler - N900-specific: kill klomplayer when recieving a phone call
klomp-cmd - sends messages to mplayer, and modifies playlist
klomp-db - manages and queries the main klomp sqlite database {main backend}
klomp-fifo-writer - repeatedly query for song pos by writing to mplayer fifo
klomp-lib - turns library names into absolute paths
klomp-size - cli frontend to print a summary of disk space, not used internally
klomp-sync - syncs another computer's klomp libraries using rsync
klomp-tag - cli frontend to Klomp/Tag.pm, not used internally
klomp-term - launches klomp using term cmd, and ensures only one instance
klomp-update - cli frontend to klomp-db, updates klomp libraries
klomplayer - mplayer wrapper that updates a file with time position
Klomp/Tag.pm - perl module for actually reading tags from media files

$HOME/.klompdb - default location for sqlite db
$HOME/.klomplib - default location for library path definitions
$HOME/.klompcur - current song's info and current position
$HOME/.klomplist - the central play queue; absolute paths that play in order
$HOME/.klomphistory - songs that have played or been skipped, for re-playing


**** Dependencies ****
klomp, klomp-search     Term::ReadKey
klomp-call-handler      python
klomplayer              mplayer
flacmirror              dir2ogg

just GNU/Linux and perl for:
klomp-cmd, klomp-lib, klomp-term, klomp-fifo-writer

klomp-db
 to update the library and read tags from files, you need:
   eyeD3 {mp3}
   lltag {ogg and flac}
   Audio::WMA {wma}
   AtomicParsley {mp4, m4a, m4p, m4v, m4b}
 to get ascii transliteration, you need:
   Text::Unidecode
 to get improved japanese transliteration, you need:
   Lingua::JA::Romanize::Japanese
