CLI music player
qdb is a perl script that creates, updates, and queries a sqlite database.
q is a cli frontend for qdb.
flacmirror maintains a parallel directory full of oggs that
 correspond to the flacs in your library

qdb handles: mp3, flac, ogg, m4a, wma, wav

you dont need to be able to update the db to use the music player;
 you can update the database on one computer,
 sync your music library to another computer,
 and merely copy the db file over

to update the library and read tags from files, you need:
mp3info and mp3info2 {mp3}
  sudo apt-get install mp3info
lltag {ogg and flac}
  sudo apt-get install lltag
perl module Audio::WMA {wma}
  cpan Audio::WMA
AtomicParsley {mp4, m4a, m4p, m4v, m4b}
  sudo apt-get install atomicparsley
