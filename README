========================
klomp - CLI music player
========================

klomp is a set of scripts that manage mplayer in an mpd-like fashion.
The goal is to have a pure command line music player with powerful searching,
and to work on portable linux devices {e.g.: maemo/meego/mer/android}.

Core requirements are GNU/Linux, mplayer, and perl.
{plus optional requirements for reading tags from different filetypes}
Works nicely on the Nokia N900 and Nokia N9.


**** Features ****
-Stateless: if you delete the db, it can be 100% automatically rebuilt
  never modifies song files: separate tagging utilities already exist
-Modular: well-defined, non-interactive cli
-Quasi-portable: most features depend only on gnu/linux
  very few dependencies {apart from tagging when db building}
  all perl/python scripts, not compiled
-Powerful query language {really powerful, but not well-documented}
-Flacmirror:
  lossless audio on your computer, tiny oggs on your phone, transparently
-optional python curses interface that invokes the same modular commands
-resume playback from the position you quit in the current song
-moderate resource consumption {runs smoothly on N900 - 256MB ram, 600mhz cpu}
-separation of db-building and playback/playlists;
  you can build the db on your desktop and sync to your portable device.
  the portable device does not need to install the tagging dependencies or do
  expensive computation


**** Limitations ****
klomp-db tags only: mp3, flac, ogg, m4a, wma, wav
everything else can do anything mplayer can


**** Frontend Execs ****
klomp
  interactive curses CLI for searching library,
  viewing and editing playlist, and controlling playback.
  DEPENDS: python, klomp-cmd, curses

klomp-cmd
  CLI for manipulating playlists and playback

klomp-update
  CLI to klomp-db and flacmirror for updating the database
  DEPENDS: perl, taglibs, sqlite, flacmirror

klomp-sync
  copies remote library file and syncs shared libraries and flacmirrors
  ignores flacs by default
  DEPENDS: perl

klomp-size
  prints a nice table of disk space usage for each library
  shows local disk space and space with flacmirror instead of flac
  DEPENDS: perl

klomp-lib
